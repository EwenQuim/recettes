# 🔧 CONTRIBUTING

Don't hesitate to [ask for a new feature / report a bug](https://github.com/EwenQuim/recettes/issues/new/choose).

Even better, you can **work on the project**! Run these commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EwenQuim/recettes
pip install -r requirements.txt
pre-commit install
```

I use these pre-commit hooks to standardize the way the project is organized. It might bother you but it's better for everyone -you'll be pleased to contribute to a beautiful code!

- black
- flake8
- pylint
- gitmoji

And you're ready for making a good PR 🍷
